# My First Coding Assignment

## About Me
Hi, my name is Yinglin Mai, but you can just call me Vicky. 

I graduated from college in China with a major in Japanese and spent over eight years working as a language instructor. After moving to the United States, I decided to change my career path and began my master’s journey at UF. Now in my final semester, I’m preparing to step into the coding world. Outside of work and school, I’m passionate about traveling and have explored over 30 countries.

## Past Coding Experience
Before this class, I had no prior experience with coding. To prepare myself, I began an Udemy course with Angela, which turned out to be far more interesting than I expected. However, as the lessons progressed, they became increasingly challenging, and I find myself feeling a bit lost at this point.

## Career Goals
Because of my partner's job, we frequently move around the world. My goal is to find a career that allows me to work remotely, and coding has become a promising option I’m considering.
